    <h1>Git not installed</h1>
    <p>
      This shell requires <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a> to download and
      update
      <a href="https://github.com/bodhiBit/whimsicle-apps">whimsicle-apps</a>
      from github. Please download and install a git-client and try again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively you could download the apps manually to ~/whimsicle-apps.
      Make sure you account for all dependencies, such as perhaps
      <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace-builds">Ace</a>.
